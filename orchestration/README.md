# Orchestration

Snakemake DAG. This directory is DAG wiring only — it never contains pipeline
logic itself, only how to invoke `src/sources/`, `src/common/`, and `src/enrichment/`
code and in what order. See the `Snakefile` docstring for what's wired up.

Rule files mirror where the code they invoke lives — see the `Snakefile` docstring.

## Running

Locally:
```
uv run snakemake --cores 4 all
```

On the HPC:
```
uv run snakemake --workflow-profile orchestration/profiles/slurm all
```

`all` covers incremental extraction/loading plus the versioned bulk dumps
(ror_dump, openaire_dump). It does **not** include `openalex_dump` (corev5
scope), `rules/pipeline/core_v3/enrichment.smk`, or `meta_heritage.smk` (all
postgres-backed, run by name only) — see each rule file's docstring.

## Sentinels

Rules with a real file artifact (duckdb file, downloaded dump) declare that file
directly as `output:`. Rules with no file artifact at all — `meta_heritage.smk`'s
scripts write straight to postgres — use a `touch()` sentinel under
`.snakemake/sentinels/` instead, purely so Snakemake has something to check
staleness against. Delete a sentinel to force that one job to rerun.

## Adding pipeline-version rules

Once a pipeline version has real stages (`pipelines/core_v4/{merge,analysis,
enrichment,model,serve}`, or a rebuilt-runnable `pipelines/core_v3/`), add
`rules/pipeline/core_vN/*.smk` for that version rather than stubbing them out
in advance — the DAG should only describe what's actually runnable.
